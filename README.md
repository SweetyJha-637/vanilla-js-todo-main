Todo List App – Modern JavaScript Project
State Management • Proxies • Events • ES6 Modules
Welcome to this hands-on JavaScript project where we build a powerful Todo List App using modern JavaScript development techniques—without any frameworks!
This project demonstrates how to structure your app using ES6 Modules, manage UI state with JavaScript Proxies, and handle DOM events effectively. The main goal is to mimic the reactivity and data-driven UI updates found in modern JS frameworks like React or Vue.
